        <h3>There's a bunch of other gifts I've gotten him in the past that he liked.</h1>
        <p>Here's a brief list of the physical, non-experience-based ones I've gotten him in the past. I might be forgetting some. A lot of them are fragrances, because I love stinky water, and I intend to get him many more in the future.</p>

    <div id="grappling-hook" class="gift-container">
        <img src="grappling-hook.png" class="gift" data-info="This is a grappling hook. For his many adventures and climbing things he shouldn't be climbing." />
    </div>
    
    <div id="harmonica" class="gift-container">
        <img src="harmonica.jpg" class="gift" data-info="This is a Hohner Crossover harmonica, the Rolls Royce of all harmonicas. I'd like to get a full set of these for him, but they're 70 dollars each and I know he'd be happy with some completely ordinary harmonicas anyways." />
    </div>    
    
    <div id="mug" class="gift-container">
        <img src="mug.jpg" class="gift" data-info="This is a coffee mug made out of amethyst or some geode. Of course, I would have to grow the geode myself and craft this for him, and it wouldn't have a big hole in the side thanks to AI trying to show me the interior. I would also make it with a wooden handle." />
    </div>    

    <div id="box" class="gift-container">
        <img src="box.png" class="gift" data-info="This is a little container for fun little special plants from Seth Rogen's Houseplant brand. Someday I will buy everything from it." />
    </div>    

    <div id="oil" class="gift-container">
        <img src="oil.png" class="gift" data-info="My boyfriend loves olive oil a little too much, and believes it belongs most places. We've tried Graza's Sizzle and Drizzle olive oils before, and loved them both, but Drizzle is punchier and meant to put on things plain for culinary pleasure's sake. Delish!" />
    </div>    

    <div id="incense" class="gift-container">
        <img src="incense.jpg" class="gift" data-info="A tried and true favorite incense. So economical too!" />
    </div>    

    <div id="lamp" class="gift-container">
        <img src="lamp.png" class="gift" data-info="This is a lamp from the brand Wooj. They have so many beautiful lamps, and we could always use more ambient lighting." />
    </div>    

    <div id="butter" class="gift-container">
        <img src="butter.png" class="gift" data-info="My boyfriend really likes butter on toast. I want to buy him so much fancy butter. I want to make him butter myself. And when I do, he will have a lovely copper dish to put them in, or even better, a mold like this that can shape the butter beautifully. Ideally, I would make him a butter mold by hand because I love woodworking and I could make it a silly shape." />
    </div>    

    <div id="socks" class="gift-container">
        <img src="socks.png" class="gift" data-info="My boyfriend's favorite sock brands are Goldtoe and American Trench. They both feel very good, and although Goldtoes are a bit hardier, I like American Trench's designs more. This is a pack of socks from them. I've already gotten him some socks from there, but the more, the merrier.'" />
    </div>    

    <div id="stapler" class="gift-container">
        <img src="stapler.png" class="gift" data-info="This is a pack of staples that go with this vintage pocket stapler my boyfriend has, which is currently empty. Unfortunately you can't find these specific staples anywhere on their own, and I'd have to buy a whole new pocket stapler if I wanted to acquire any of these unique staples for him. " />
    </div>    

    <div id="stool" class="gift-container">
        <img src="stool.png" class="gift" data-info="This is a lovely, multifunctional side table from Seth Rogen's Houseplant brand. Good for tapping things on to keep them clean." />

    <div id="stash" class="gift-container">
        <img src="stash.png" class="gift" data-info="This is a gorgeous, odorproof container for putting stinky stuff in. Very helpful! Very pretty! It is from the brand Cubbi." />

    <div id="sunset" class="gift-container">
        <img src="sunset.png" class="gift" data-info="My boyfriend used to have a sunset lamp, but it broke, and there's no such thing as too much ambient lighting. Nice, easy gift." />
    </div>    

    <div id="tray" class="gift-container">
        <img src="tray.png" class="gift" data-info="This is a fun little plate-like item from the brand Cubbi. Good for holding things, and tapping things on to clean them off, and just looking pretty." />
    </div>    

    <div id="painting" class="gift-container">
        <img src="painting.png" class="gift" data-info="My boyfriend loves the artist Mark Maggiori. He is spectacularly talented at painting scenes of the American West, with beautiful landscapes, billowing clouds, and almost always featuring some badass dude or girl on their horse. Of course, I'll never be able to make a painting anywhere near as gorgeous as Mark's, but at some point I'd like to make a painting for my boyfriend in his style. I'm pretty good with oil paints, so I have some hope." />
